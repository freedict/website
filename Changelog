# This is a changelog file for the website. While it is YAML, only two things
# are supported: a new entry starts with date in the format "%Y-%m-%d:", followed
# by multiple indented lines. The indented lines will be converted using
# Pandoc's Markdown dialect. Just add a | at the end of the date line to make it
# a multiline string and to avoid confusion with the formatting.
# Lines with a hash character are ignored.

  format. Thanks to Saeed Rasooli for maintaining the conversion and providing
  the integration into the FreeDict tooling, Karl Bartel for updating the
  Website and Sebastian Humenda for helping out on various build system and
  API-related issues.

  If you can, please help us update
  [the Website translations](community/index.html#website-translations)!

  English-Polish is one of our more complex dictionary, regarding the TEI XML
  markup. This has led to many tools giving up on its include references. Now
  all the glitches have been fixed and 0.2.1 is available in all supported
  formats and with phonetics.

  For English-Swedish (eng-swe) users: we have had a
  [bug report](https://github.com/freedict/tools/issues/38)
  about errorneous pronunciation. It turned out that the dictionary contained
  incorrectly generated phonemes and that the dictionary was very outdated in
  the first place. We hence chose to replace it with the WikDict version and
  auto-generated the phonemes with our tooling. Ha det så roligt!

  FreeDict.org was unavailable for several hours. This was due to a breakage
  after upgrading internal software components, which required additional fixes
  to the website backend. We apologise for any inconvenience.

  dictionaries made available by Karl Bartel.

  Re-release of all dictionary exports: Due to a bug in the IPA generation, some
  dictionaries had incorrect IPA transcriptions for headwords. This has been
  fixed for all dictionaries now.

  **[FreeDict HackFest 2018](https://freedict.github.io) — come and join us!**  
  This is our second community event where we are coming together to work on our
  tooling and dictionaries. This event is for both newcomers and regular
  contributors. It would be great to see you around! More information can be
  found [here](https://freedict.github.io).

  Nearly all of our dictionaries now ship IPA pronunciation transcriptions. The
  International Pronunciation Alphabet (IPA) is a standardised way to transcribe
  the pronunciation of a word in any language. Whenever a dictionary gets
  released, IPA is added, as long as the generator (based on Espeak or
  Espeak-ng) supports the language.

2018-07-23:
  FreeDict now ships a substantial selection of WikDict dictionaries, therefore
  we now ship over 140 dictionaries!
  The WikDict project processes and encodes Wiktionary dictionaries and makes
  them
  available in the TEI format. These dictionaries are now regularly imported
  into FreeDict.

2018-05-01:
  You can now verify our downloads with a SHA512 checksum. For now, the
  checksums are only available using the FreeDict API. See our wiki for more
  details.

2018-04-15:
  FreeDict.org has been relaunched. After our Hackathon last year and after many
  more hours of work, the new website is online. Equipped with a fresh design
  and filled with new content, we hope that you will find exactly the
  information that you are looking for. If not or if you have other suggestions,
  let us know.

2018-03-29:
  Finally, there is a first early draft of the brand-new FreeDict website
  online. It is still bare-bones and not translated. We would appreciate if you
  could send us feedback.
