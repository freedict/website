# This is a changelog file for the website. While it is YAML, only two things
# are supported: a new entry starts with date in the format "%Y-%m-%d:", followed
# by multiple indented lines. The indented lines will be converted using
# Pandoc's Markdown dialect. Just add a | at the end of the date line to make it
# a multiline string and to avoid confusion with the formatting.
# Lines with a hash character are ignored.

  **[FreeDict HackFest 2018](https://freedict.github.io) — come and join us!  
  This is our second community event where we are coming together to work on our
  tooling and dictionaries. This event is for both newbies and contributors,
  feel free to [join us](https://freedict.github.io)!

  Nearly all of our dictionaries now ship IPA pronunciation transcriptions. The
  International Pronunciation Alphabet (IPA) is a standardised way to transcribe
  the pronunciation of a word in any language. Whenever a dictionary gets
  released, IPA is added, as long as the generator (based on Espeak or
  Espeak-ng) supports the language.

  FreeDict now ships a substantial selection of WikDict dictionaries, therefore
  we now ship over 140 dictionaries!
  The WikDict project processes and encodes Wiktionary dictionaries and makes
  them
  available in the TEI format. These dictionaries are now regularly imported
  into FreeDict.

  You can now verify our downloads with a SHA512 checksum. For now, the
  checksums are only available using the FreeDict API. See our wiki for more
  details.

  FreeDict.org has been relaunched. After our Hackathon last year and after many
  more hours of work, the new website is online. Equipped with a fresh design
  and filled with new content, we hope that you will find exactly the
  information that you are looking for. If not or if you have other suggestions,
  let us know.

  Finally, there is a first early draft of the brand-new FreeDict website
  online. It is still bare-bones and not translated. We would appreciate if you
  could send us feedback.
